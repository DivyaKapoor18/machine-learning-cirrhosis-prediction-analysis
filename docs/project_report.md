# Cirrhosis Patient Clustering Analysis - Technical Report

## Executive Summary
This report details the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze cirrhosis patient data, identifying natural patient subgroups that may inform clinical decision-making and personalized treatment approaches.

## 1. Introduction
Liver cirrhosis is a serious medical condition characterized by scarring of the liver tissue. Early identification of patient subgroups with different disease progression patterns can significantly impact treatment outcomes and resource allocation.

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Handled using mean imputation for numerical features
- **Categorical Encoding**: One-hot encoding with first category drop
- **Feature Scaling**: Standardization to ensure equal feature contribution

### 2.2 Clustering Algorithms

#### K-Means Clustering
- **Algorithm**: Centroid-based partitioning
- **Parameters**: k=3 clusters, random_state=42
- **Advantages**: Simple, efficient for spherical clusters

#### DBSCAN Clustering
- **Algorithm**: Density-based spatial clustering
- **Parameters**: eps=3.6, min_samples=5
- **Advantages**: Handles noise, identifies arbitrary cluster shapes

### 2.3 Evaluation Metrics
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures cluster cohesion and separation
- **Cluster Analysis**: Comparative analysis of cluster characteristics

## 3. Results

### 3.1 K-Means Results
Identified 3 distinct patient clusters with varying disease severity markers.

### 3.2 DBSCAN Results
Produced 3 clusters with effective noise handling, revealing dense patient subgroups.

## 4. Clinical Implications
The clustering analysis provides insights for:
- Patient risk stratification
- Personalized treatment planning
- Resource allocation optimization

## 5. Limitations and Future Work
- Dataset size limitations
- Cross-validation requirements
- Integration with additional clinical data
